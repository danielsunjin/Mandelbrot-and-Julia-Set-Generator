# Mandelbrot-and-Julia-Set-Generator
The code in this repository includes my custom complex number Python class and code to generate Mandelbrot and Julia sets using the class in Python. This project was inspired by the GeekForGeeks article [Mandelbrot Fractal Set visualization in Python](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mandelbrot-fractal-set-visualization-in-python/).

Python libraries required to run the code:
- PIL
- numpy
